  <h3 id="m13">Legal Bases for the Processing</h3>
  <p>In the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of
    personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of
    your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in
    individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his
      or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)</strong> - Performance of a
      contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior
      to entering into a contract.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for
      compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the
      legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden
      by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal
      data.</li>
    <li><strong>Job application process as a pre-contractual or contractual relationship (Article 6 (1)(b)
        GDPR)</strong> - If special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) GDPR (e.g.
      health data, such as severely handicapped status or ethnic origin) are requested from applicants within the
      framework of the application procedure, so that the responsible person or the person concerned can carry out the
      obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment
      and social security and social protection law, their processing shall be carried out in accordance with Article
      9 (2)(b) GDPR , in the case of the protection of vital interests of applicants or other persons on the basis of
      Article 9 (2)(c) GDPR or for the purposes of preventive health care or occupational medicine, for the assessment
      of the employee's ability to work, for medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sector or
      for the administration of systems and services in the health or social sector in accordance with Article 9
      (2)(d) GDPR. In the case of a communication of special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their
      processing is carried out on the basis of Article 9 (2)(a) GDPR.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations
    apply
    to data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in
    Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the
    right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data,
    processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling.
    Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), in particular
    with regard to the establishment, execution or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of
    employees. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
  <h2 id="m27">Security Precautions</h2>
  <p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into
    account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing
    as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to
    ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
  <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by
    controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and
    separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are
    respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take
    the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and
    service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.</p>
  <p>TLS encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online services, we use TLS encryption. You can
    recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.</p>
  <h2 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>In the context of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other places,
    companies or persons or that it is disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service
    providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are embedded in a website. In such a
    case, the legal requirements will be respected and in particular corresponding contracts or agreements, which serve
    the protection of your data, will be concluded with the recipients of your data.</p>
  <p>Data Transmission within the Group of Companies: We may transfer personal data to other companies within our group
    of
    companies or otherwise grant them access to this data. Insofar as this disclosure is for administrative purposes,
    the disclosure of the data is based on our legitimate business and economic interests or otherwise, if it is
    necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations or if the consent of the data subjects or otherwise a legal
    permission is present.</p>
  <p>Data Transfer within the Organization: We may transfer or otherwise provide access to personal information to other
    locations within our organization. Insofar as this disclosure is for administrative purposes, the disclosure of the
    data is based on our legitimate business and economic interests or otherwise, if it is necessary to fulfill our
    contractual obligations or if the consent of those concerned or otherwise a legal permission is present.</p>
  <h2 id="m24">Data Processing in Third Countries</h2>
  <p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or
    the
    processing takes place in the context of the use of third party services or disclosure or transfer of data to other
    persons, bodies or companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal requirements. </p>
  <p>Subject to express consent or transfer required by contract or law, we process or have processed the data only in
    third countries with a recognised level of data protection, on the basis of special guarantees, such as a
    contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission or if certifications or
    binding internal data protection regulations justify the processing (Article 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the
    EU Commission: <a
      href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en"
      target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en</a>).
  </p>
  <h2 id="m12">Erasure of data</h2>
  <p>The data processed by us will be erased in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as their processing is
    revoked or other permissions no longer apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data no longer applies or they
    are not required for the purpose). If the data is not deleted because they are required for other and legally
    permissible purposes, their processing is limited to these purposes. This means that the data will be restricted and
    not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax
    reasons or for which storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of
    another natural or legal person. In the context of our information on data processing, we may provide users with
    further information on the deletion and retention of data that is specific to the respective processing operation.
  </p>
  <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
  <p>Cookies are small text files or other data records that store information on end devices and read information from
    the end devices. For example, to store the login status in a user account, the contents of a shopping cart in an
    e-shop, the contents accessed or the functions used. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, e.g. for
    purposes of functionality, security and convenience of online offers as well as the creation of analyses of visitor
    flows.</p>
  <p><strong>Information on consent: </strong>We use cookies in accordance with the statutory provisions. Therefore, we
    obtain prior consent from users, except when it is not required by law. In particular, consent is not required if
    the storage and reading of information, including cookies, is strictly necessary in order to provide an information
    society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user. The revocable consent will be clearly communicated
    to the user and will contain the information on the respective cookie use.</p>
  <p><strong>Information on legal bases under data protection law: </strong>The legal basis under data protection law on
    which we process users' personal data with the use of cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users
    consent, the legal basis for processing their data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the
    help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online
    services and improvement of its usability) or, if this is done in the context of the fulfillment of our contractual
    obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. For which purposes the
    cookies are processed by us, we do clarify in the course of this privacy policy or in the context of our consent and
    processing procedures.</p>
  <p><strong>Retention period:</strong> With regard to the retention period, a distinction is drawn between the
    following
    types of cookies:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Temporary cookies (also known as "session cookies"):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at the
      latest after a user has left an online service and closed his or her end device (i.e. browser or mobile
      application). </li>
    <li><strong>Permanent cookies</strong>: Permanent cookies remain stored even after the terminal device is closed.
      For example, the login status can be saved, or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits
      a website again. Likewise, user data collected with the help of cookies can be used for reach measurement.
      Unless we provide users with explicit information about the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., as part
      of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage period can be up to
      two years.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out):</strong> Users can revoke the consent they have
    given at any time and also file an objection to processing in accordance with the legal requirements in Article 21
    GDPR. Users can also declare their objection by means of the settings of their browser, e.g. by deactivating the use
    of cookies (whereby this may also limit the functionality of our online services). An objection to the use of
    cookies for online marketing purposes, can also be declared via the websites <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info"
      target="_blank">https://optout.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/"
      target="_blank">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/.</a></p>
  <p><strong>Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:</strong></p>
  <ul class="m-elements">
    <li><strong>Processing Cookie Data on the Basis of Consent: </strong>We use a cookie management solution in which
      users' consent to the use of cookies, or the procedures and providers mentioned in the cookie management
      solution, can be obtained, managed and revoked by the users. The declaration of consent is stored so that it
      does not have to be retrieved again and the consent can be proven in accordance with the legal obligation.
      Storage can take place server-sided and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-out cookie or with the aid of comparable
      technologies) in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or and/or his/her device. Subject to
      individual details of the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The
      duration of the storage of the consent can be up to two years. In this case, a pseudonymous user identifier is
      formed and stored with the date/time of consent, information on the scope of the consent (e.g. which categories
      of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system and used end device.</li>

  <h2 id="m317">Business services</h2>
  <p>We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and interested parties (collectively
    referred to as "contractual partners") within the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well
    as associated actions and communication with the contractual partners or pre-contractually, e.g. to answer
    inquiries.</p>

    to provide the agreed services, any update obligations and remedies in the event of warranty and other service
    disruptions. In addition, we process the data to protect our rights and for the purpose of administrative tasks
    associated with these obligations and company organization. Furthermore, we process the data on the basis of our
    legitimate interests in proper and economical business management as well as security measures to protect our
    contractual partners and our business operations from misuse, endangerment of their data, secrets, information and
    rights (e.g. for the involvement of telecommunications, transport and other auxiliary services as well as
    subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). Within the framework
    of applicable law, we only disclose the data of contractual partners to third parties to the extent that this is
    necessary for the aforementioned purposes or to fulfill legal obligations. Contractual partners will be informed
    about further forms of processing, e.g. for marketing purposes, within the scope of this privacy policy.</p>
  <p>Which data are necessary for the aforementioned purposes, we inform the contracting partners before or in the
    context
    of the data collection, e.g. in online forms by special marking (e.g. colors), and/or symbols (e.g. asterisks or the
    like), or personally.</p>
  <p>We delete the data after expiry of statutory warranty and comparable obligations, i.e. in principle after expiry of
    4
    years, unless the data is stored in a customer account or must be kept for legal reasons of archiving. The statutory
    retention period for documents relevant under tax law as well as for commercial books, inventories, opening balance
    sheets, annual financial statements, the instructions required to understand these documents and other
    organizational documents and accounting records is ten years and for received commercial and business letters and
    reproductions of sent commercial and business letters six years. The period begins at the end of the calendar year
    in which the last entry was made in the book, the inventory, the opening balance sheet, the annual financial
    statements or the management report was prepared, the commercial or business letter was received or sent, or the
    accounting document was created, furthermore the record was made or the other documents were created. </p>

      and do not appear annoying. The Facebook pixel also enables us to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for
      statistical and market research purposes by showing whether users were referred to our website after clicking on

      particular the transfer of the data to the parent company Meta Platforms, Inc. in the USA (on the basis of

      within our online offer or transmitted to Facebook. The processing of contact information serves to form target
      groups (so-called " Custom Audiences") for the display of content and advertising information based on the
      presumed interests of users. The collection, or transmission and matching with data available on Facebook is not
      in plain text, but as so-called "hash values", i.e. mathematical representations of the data (this method is
      used, for example, in the storage of passwords). After the matching to create target groups, the Contact

      provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's
      browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are
      transmitted which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical
      environment. This data may be processed on a server of the provider of the fonts in the USA - When visiting our
      online services, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API. The Google Fonts
      Web API provides users with Google Fonts' cascading style sheets (CSS) and then with the fonts specified in the
      CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by each user to access the Internet, (2) the requested
      URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent describing the browser and
      operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referral URL (i.e., the web page where the
      Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are not logged or stored on Google servers and they are not
      analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referring URL).
      Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for
      which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font
      family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must match the font that is generated for the
      particular browser type. The user agent is logged primarily for debugging purposes and is used to generate
      aggregate usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregate usage statistics are
      published on Google Fonts' Analytics page. Finally, the referral URL is logged so that the data can be used for
      production maintenance and to generate an aggregate report on top integrations based on the number of font
      requests. Google says it does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to profile end users or
      serve targeted ads; <strong>Service provider</strong>: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street,

  <h2 id="m391">Communication via Messenger</h2>
  <p>We use messenger services for communication purposes and therefore ask you to observe the following information
    regarding the functionality of the messenger services, encryption, use of the metadata of the communication and your
    objection options.</p>
  <p>You can also contact us by alternative means, e.g. telephone or e-mail. Please use the contact options provided to
    you or use the contact options provided within our online services.</p>
  <p>In the case of encryption of content (i.e. the content of your message and attachments), we point out that the
    communication content (i.e. the content of the message and attachments) is encrypted end-to-end. This means that the
    content of the messages is not visible, not even by the messenger service providers themselves. You should always
    use a current version of the messenger service with activated encryption, so that the encryption of the message
    contents is guaranteed. </p>
  <p>However, we would like to point out to our communication partners that although messenger service providers do not
    see the content, they can find out that and when communication partners communicate with us and process technical
    information on the communication partner's device used and, depending on the settings of their device, also location
    information (so-called metadata). </p>
  <p><strong>Information on Legal basis: </strong> If we ask communication partners for permission before communicating
    with them via messenger services, the legal basis of our processing of their data is their consent. Otherwise, if we
    do not request consent and you contact us, for example, voluntarily, we use messenger services in our dealings with
    our contractual partners and as part of the contract initiation process as a contractual measure and in the case of
    other interested parties and communication partners on the basis of our legitimate interests in fast and efficient
    communication and meeting the needs of our communication partners for communication via messenger services. We would
    also like to point out that we do not transmit the contact data provided to us to the messenger service providers
    for the first time without your consent.</p>
  <p><strong>Withdrawal, objection and deletion: </strong> You can withdraw your consent or object to communication with
    us via messenger services at any time. In the case of communication via messenger services, we delete the messages
    in accordance with our general data retention policy (i.e. as described above after the end of contractual
    relationships, archiving requirements, etc.) and otherwise as soon as we can assume that we have answered any
    information provided by the communication partners, if no reference to a previous conversation is to be expected and
    there are no legal obligations to store the messages to prevent their deletion.</p>
  <p><strong>Reservation of reference to other means of communication:</strong> Finally, we would like to point out that
    we reserve the right, for reasons of your safety, not to answer inquiries about messenger services. This is the case
    if, for example, internal contractual matters require special secrecy or if an answer via the messenger services
    does not meet the formal requirements. In such cases we refer you to more appropriate communication channels.</p>

  <h2 id="m735">Video Conferences, Online Meetings, Webinars and Screen-Sharing</h2>
  <p>We use platforms and applications of other providers (hereinafter referred to as "Conference Platforms") for the
    purpose of conducting video and audio conferences, webinars and other types of video and audio meetings (hereinafter
    collectively referred to as "Conference"). When using the Conference Platforms and their services, we comply with
    the legal requirements. </p>
  <p><strong>Data processed by Conference Platforms:</strong> In the course of participation in a Conference, the Data
    of
    the participants listed below are processed. The scope of the processing depends, on the one hand, on which data is
    requested in the context of a specific Conference (e.g., provision of access data or clear names) and which optional
    information is provided by the participants. In addition to processing for the purpose of conducting the conference,
    participants' Data may also be processed by the Conference Platforms for security purposes or service optimization.
    The processed Date includes personal information (first name, last name), contact information (e-mail address,
    telephone number), access data (access codes or passwords), profile pictures, information on professional
    position/function, the IP address of the internet access, information on the participants' end devices, their
    operating system, the browser and its technical and linguistic settings, information on the content-related
    communication processes, i.e. entries in chats and audio and video data, as well as the use of other available
    functions (e.g. surveys). The content of communications is encrypted to the extent technically provided by the
    conference providers. If participants are registered as users with the Conference Platforms, then further data may
    be processed in accordance with the agreement with the respective Conference Provider.</p>
  <p><strong>Logging and recording:</strong> If text entries, participation results (e.g. from surveys) as well as video
    or audio recordings are recorded, this will be transparently communicated to the participants in advance and they
    will be asked - if necessary - for their consent.</p>
  <p><strong>Data protection measures of the participants:</strong> Please refer to the data privacy information of the
    Conference Platforms for details on the processing of your data and select the optimum security and data privacy
    settings for you within the framework of the settings of the conference platforms. Furthermore, please ensure data
    and privacy protection in the background of your recording for the duration of a Conference (e.g., by notifying
    roommates, locking doors, and using the background masking function, if technically possible). Links to the
    conference rooms as well as access data, should not be passed on to unauthorized third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> Insofar as, in addition to the Conference Platforms, we also process users'
    data and ask users for their consent to use contents from the Conferences or certain functions (e.g. consent to a
    recording of Conferences), the legal basis of the processing is this consent. Furthermore, our processing may be
    necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations (e.g. in participant lists, in the case of reprocessing
    of Conference results, etc.). Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests in
    efficient and secure communication with our communication partners.</p>

  <h2 id="m210">Job Application Process</h2>
  <p>The application process requires applicants to provide us with the data necessary for their assessment and
    selection.
    The information required can be found in the job description or, in the case of online forms, in the information
    contained therein. </p>
  <p>In principle, the required information includes personal information such as name, address, a contact option and
    proof of the qualifications required for a particular employment. Upon request, we will be happy to provide you with
    additional information.</p>
  <p>If made available, applicants can submit their applications via an online form. The data will be transmitted to us
    encrypted according to the state of the art. Applicants can also send us their applications by e-mail. Please note,
    however, that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted
    during transport, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore accept no
    responsibility for the transmission path of the application between the sender and the reception on our server. For
    the purposes of searching for applicants, submitting applications and selecting applicants, we may make use of the
    applicant management and recruitment software, platforms and services of third-party providers in compliance with
    legal requirements. Applicants are welcome to contact us about how to submit their application or send it to us by
    regular mail.</p>
  <p><strong>Processing of special categories of data:</strong> If special categories of personal data within the
    meaning
    of Article 9 (1) GDPR (e.g. health data, such as severely handicapped status or ethnic origin) are requested from
    applicants within the framework of the application procedure, so that the responsible person or the person concerned
    can exercise his/her rights arising from labour law and social security and social protection law and fulfil his/her
    duties in this regard, their processing shall be carried out in accordance with Article 9 (1)(b) GDPR, in the case
    of the protection of vital interests of applicants or other persons pursuant to Article 9 (1)(c) GDPR or for the
    purposes of preventive health care or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the employee's ability to work,
    for medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the administration of systems and
    services in the health or social sector in accordance with Article 9 (1)(h) GDPR. In the case of a communication of
    special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their processing is carried out on the basis of Article 9
    (1)(a) GDPR.</p>
  <p><strong>Ereasure of data:</strong> In the event of a successful application, the data provided by the applicants
    may
    be further processed by us for the purposes of the employment relationship. Otherwise, if the application for a job
    offer is not successful, the applicant's data will be deleted. Applicants' data will also be deleted if an
    application is withdrawn, to which applicants are entitled at any time. Subject to a justified revocation by the
    applicant, the deletion will take place at the latest after the expiry of a period of six months, so that we can
    answer any follow-up questions regarding the application and comply with our duty of proof under the regulations on
    equal treatment of applicants. Invoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses are archived in accordance with tax
    regulations.</p>
  <p><strong>Admission to a talent pool - </strong>Admission to an talent pool, if offered, is based on consent.
    Applicants are informed that their consent to be included in the talent pool is voluntary, has no influence on the
    current application process and that they can revoke their consent at any time for the future.</p>

  <h2 id="m17">Newsletter and Electronic Communications</h2>
  <p>We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic communications (hereinafter referred to as "newsletters") only
    with
    the consent of the recipient or a legal permission. Insofar as the contents of the newsletter are specifically
    described within the framework of registration, they are decisive for the consent of the user. Otherwise, our
    newsletters contain information about our services and us.</p>
  <p>In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to enter your e-mail address. We may, however,
    ask you to provide a name for the purpose of contacting you personally in the newsletter or to provide further
    information if this is required for the purposes of the newsletter.</p>
  <p><strong>Double opt-in procedure:</strong> The registration to our newsletter takes place in general in a so-called
    Double-Opt-In procedure. This means that you will receive an e-mail after registration asking you to confirm your
    registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with external e-mail addresses. </p>
  <p>The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to
    the legal requirements. This includes storing the login and confirmation times as well as the IP address. Likewise
    the changes of your data stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.</p>
  <p><strong>Deletion and restriction of processing:</strong> We may store the unsubscribed email addresses for up to
    three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them to provide evidence of prior consent. The
    processing of these data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual deletion
    request is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In
    the case of an obligation to permanently observe an objection, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address
    solely for this purpose in a blocklist.</p>
  <p>The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of
    proving its proper course. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our
    legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.</p>

    <li><strong>Measurement of opening rates and click rates: </strong>The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon",
      i.e. a pixel-sized file, which is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a
      mailing service provider, from its server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information such as
      information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are first
      collected.

      This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter on the basis of technical data or
      target groups and their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval points (which can be determined with
      the help of the IP address) or access times. This analysis also includes determining whether newsletters are
      opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. This information is assigned to the individual
      newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until the profiles are deleted. The evaluations serve us much
      more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content
      according to the interests of our users.

      The measurement of opening rates and click rates as well as the storage of the measurement results in the
      profiles of the users and their further processing are based on the consent of the users.

      A separate objection to the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire
      newsletter subscription must be cancelled or objected to. In this case, the stored profile information will be
      deleted; <strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR).</li>

  <p>Web analysis is used to evaluate the visitor traffic on our website and may include the behaviour, interests or
    demographic information of users, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of web analysis we
    can e.g. recognize, at which time our online services or their functions or contents are most frequently used or
    requested for repeatedly, as well as which areas require optimization.</p>
  <p>In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures, e.g. to test and optimize different versions of our
    online services or their components.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, i.e. data aggregated for a usage process, can be created for these
    purposes
    and information can be stored in a browser or in a terminal device and read from it. The information collected
    includes, in particular, websites visited and elements used there as well as technical information such as the
    browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have agreed to the collection of
    their location data from us or from the providers of the services we use, location data may also be processed.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, that is data summarized for a usage process or user, may be created for
    these purposes and stored in a browser or terminal device (so-called "cookies") or similar processes may be used for
    the same purpose. The information collected includes, in particular, websites visited and elements used there as
    well as technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If
    users have consented to the collection of their location data or profiles to us or to the providers of the services
    we use, these may also be processed, depending on the provider.</p>
  <p>The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use any existing IP masking procedure (i.e.
    pseudonymisation by shortening the IP address) to protect the user. In general, within the framework of web
    analysis, A/B testing and optimisation, no user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is stored, but pseudonyms.
    This means that we, as well as the providers of the software used, do not know the actual identity of the users, but
    only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective processes.</p>

    <li><strong>Google Analytics 4: </strong>We use Google Analytics to perform user analysis based on a pseudonymous
      user identification number. This identification number does not contain any unique data, such as names or email
      addresses. It is used to assign analysis information to an end device in order to recognize which content users
      have accessed within one or various usage processes, which search terms they have used, have accessed again or
      have interacted with our online services. Likewise, the time of use and its duration are stored, as well as the
      sources of users referring to our online services and technical aspects of their end devices and browsers. In
      the process, pseudonymous profiles of users are created with information from the use of various devices, and
      cookies may be used. In Analytics, higher level geographic location data is provided by collecting the following
      metadata based on IP search: "city" (and the derived latitude and longitude of the city), "continent",
      "country", "region", "subcontinent" (and the ID-based equivalents). To ensure the protection of user data in the
      EU, Google receives and processes all user data via domains and servers within the EU. The IP address of users
      is not logged and is shortened by the last two digits by default. The shortening of the IP address takes place
      on EU servers for EU users. In addition, all sensitive data collected from users in the EU is deleted before it

  <h2 id="m264">Online Marketing</h2>
  <p>We process personal data for the purposes of online marketing, which may include in particular the marketing of
    advertising space or the display of advertising and other content (collectively referred to as "Content") based on
    the potential interests of users and the measurement of their effectiveness. </p>
  <p>For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar
    procedure in which the relevant user information for the display of the aforementioned content is stored. This
    information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, communication partners
    and technical information such as the browser used, computer system used and information on usage times and used
    functions. If users have consented to the collection of their sideline data, these can also be processed.</p>
  <p>The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use provided IP masking procedures (i.e.
    pseudonymisation
    by shortening the IP address) to ensure the protection of the user's by using a pseudonym. In general, within the
    framework of the online marketing process, no clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is secured, but
    pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of online marketing procedures, do not know the actual
    identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.</p>
  <p>The information in the profiles is usually stored in the cookies or similar memorizing procedures. These cookies
    can
    later, generally also on other websites that use the same online marketing technology, be read and analyzed for
    purposes of content display, as well as supplemented with other data and stored on the server of the online
    marketing technology provider.</p>
  <p>Exceptionally, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are members
    of
    a social network whose online marketing technology we use and the network links the profiles of the users in the
    aforementioned data. Please note that users may enter into additional agreements with the social network providers
    or other service providers, e.g. by consenting as part of a registration process.</p>
  <p>As a matter of principle, we only gain access to summarised information about the performance of our
    advertisements.
    However, within the framework of so-called conversion measurement, we can check which of our online marketing
    processes have led to a so-called conversion, i.e. to the conclusion of a contract with us. The conversion
    measurement is used alone for the performance analysis of our marketing activities.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise stated, we kindly ask you to consider that cookies used will be stored for a period of two years.

  <p>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate
    with the users active there or to offer information about us.</p>
  <p>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may entail risks for
    users, e.g. by making it more difficult to enforce users' rights.</p>
  <p>In addition, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes.
    For
    example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the associated interests of users. The user
    profiles can then be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks which are presumed
    to correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer,
    in which the user's usage behaviour and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles
    independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective networks or
    will become members later on).</p>
  <p>For a detailed description of the respective processing operations and the opt-out options, please refer to the
    respective data protection declarations and information provided by the providers of the respective networks.</p>
  <p>Also in the case of requests for information and the exercise of rights of data subjects, we point out that these
    can
    be most effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can
    directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need help, please do not hesitate to
    contact us.</p>

    <li><strong>Google Fonts (from Google Server): </strong>Obtaining fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of a
      technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to timeliness and
      loading times, their uniform presentation and consideration of possible restrictions under licensing law. The
      provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's
      browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are
      transmitted which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical
      environment. This data may be processed on a server of the provider of the fonts in the USA - When visiting our
      online services, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API. The Google Fonts
      Web API provides users with Google Fonts' cascading style sheets (CSS) and then with the fonts specified in the
      CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by each user to access the Internet, (2) the requested
      URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent describing the browser and
      operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referral URL (i.e., the web page where the
      Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are not logged or stored on Google servers and they are not
      analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referring URL).
      Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for
      which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font
      family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must match the font that is generated for the
      particular browser type. The user agent is logged primarily for debugging purposes and is used to generate
      aggregate usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregate usage statistics are
      published on Google Fonts' Analytics page. Finally, the referral URL is logged so that the data can be used for
      production maintenance and to generate an aggregate report on top integrations based on the number of font
      requests. Google says it does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to profile end users or
      serve targeted ads; <strong>Service provider</strong>: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street,

    <li><strong>Right of withdrawal for consents:</strong> You have the right to revoke consents at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation as to whether the data in question
      will be processed and to be informed of this data and to receive further information and a copy of the data in
      accordance with the provisions of the law.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You have the right, in accordance with the law, to request the
      completion of the data concerning you or the rectification of the incorrect data concerning you.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Erasure and Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> In accordance with the statutory

      the supervisory authority of your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that
      the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="m42">Terminology and Definitions</h2>
  <p>This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are drawn from the
    law
    and defined mainly in Article 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other
    hand, are intended above all for the purpose of comprehension. The terms are sorted alphabetically.</p>
  <ul class="glossary">
    <li><strong>Affiliate Tracking:</strong> Custom Audiences refers to the process of determining target groups for
      advertising purposes, e.g. the display of advertisements. For example, a user's interest in certain products or
      topics on the Internet may be used to conclude that the user is interested in advertisements for similar
      products or the online store in which the user viewed the products. "Lookalike Audiences" is the term used to
      describe content that is viewed as suitable by users whose profiles or interests presumably correspond to the
      users for whom the profiles were created. For the purposes of creating custom audiences and lookalike audiences,
      cookies and web beacons are typically used. </li>
    <li><strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN):</strong> A "Content Delivery Network" (CDN) is a service with whose help
      contents of our online services, in particular large media files, such as graphics or scripts, can be delivered
      faster and more securely with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet. </li>
    <li><strong>Controller:</strong> "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other
      body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conversion tracking:</strong> Conversion tracking is a method used to evaluate the effectiveness of
      marketing measures. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the devices of the users within the websites
      on which the marketing measures take place and then called up again on the target website (e.g. we can thus
      trace whether the advertisements placed by us on other websites were successful). </li>
    <li><strong>Custom Audiences:</strong> Target group formation (or "custom audiences") is the term used when target
      groups are determined for advertising purposes, e.g. display of advertisements. For example, a user's interest
      in certain products or topics on the Internet may be used to infer that that user is interested in
      advertisements for similar products or the online store in which they viewed the products. Lookalike Audiences"
      (or similar target groups) is the term used to describe content that is viewed as suitable by users whose
      profiles or interests presumably correspond to the users for whom the profiles were created. Cookies are
      generally used for the purposes of creating custom audiences and lookalike audiences. Target groups can be
      created by processing visitors of an online service or can be uploaded to the provider of an online marketing
      technology by means of uploading (which is usually done pseudonymised). </li>
    <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
      natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
      indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data,
      an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
      economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. </li>
    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The term "processing" covers a wide range and practically every handling of data,
      be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure. </li>
    <li><strong>Profiles with user-related information:</strong> The processing of "profiles with user-related
      information", or "profiles" for short, includes any kind of automated processing of personal data that consists
      of using these personal data to analyse, evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural
      person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include different information concerning demographics,
      behaviour and interests, such as interaction with websites and their content, etc.) (e.g. interests in certain
      content or products, click behaviour on a website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for
      profiling purposes. </li>
    <li><strong>Remarketing:</strong> Remarketing" or "retargeting" is the term used, for example, to indicate for
      advertising purposes which products a user is interested in on a website in order to remind the user of these
      products on other websites, e.g. in advertisements. </li>
    <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> "Tracking" is the term used when the behaviour of users can be traced across several
      websites. As a rule, behavior and interest information with regard to the websites used is stored in cookies or
      on the servers of the tracking technology providers (so-called profiling). This information can then be used,
      for example, to display advertisements to users presumably corresponding to their interests. </li>
    <li><strong>Web Analytics:</strong> Web Analytics serves the evaluation of visitor traffic of online services and
      can determine their behavior or interests in certain information, such as content of websites. With the help of
      web analytics, website owners, for example, can recognize at what time visitors visit their website and what
      content they are interested in. This allows them, for example, to optimize the content of the website to better
      meet the needs of their visitors. For purposes of web analytics, pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are
      frequently used in order to recognise returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an
      online service. </li>
